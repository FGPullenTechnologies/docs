<h1>Crowd-sourcing our Dev Center</h1>

<p class="subtitle">We're look to the community to help us make the Dev Center the best of its kind.</p>

<p><img src="/images/sticker.jpg" style="float: left; padding: 0 20px 20px 0;">We want this sticker to be your sticker. So we're giving it to you. All you have to do is contribute to the Dev Center&mdash;<a href="https://github.com/iron-io/docs/issues/new">open an issue</a> or fix something and send us a pull request. Not only do you get a better Dev Center, you get a really sweet sticker. How's that for a win-win?</p>

<p style="clear: both;"><img src="/images/shirt.jpg" style="float:right; padding: 0 0 20px 20px;">For more active contributors, we have these really cool t-shirts, as well. You can hack away on your latest super-cool project <em>in style</em> with this awesome shirt&mdash;the very same shirts our team sports out and about! We award these for continued and significant contributions to the Dev Center, so just keep filing issues and sending pull requests, and we'll get in touch. Or we suppose you could just ask.</p>

<h3>But wait, there's more!</h3>

<p>We also send out coffee, energy drinks, and other assorted goods on occasion for extra special contributions. These can be anything from gobs of hackerfuel to limited edition Iron.io swag. Surprise with some great work and you'll win a bunch of fans at Iron.io.</p>
