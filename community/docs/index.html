<h1>Our Dev Center Is Your Dev Center</h1>

<p class="subtitle">The Dev Center is a community resource for the community, by the community. While Iron.io's Developer Experience Team manages the Dev Center, we look to the community to help us make it the best of its kind.</p>

<p><img src="/images/sticker.jpg" style="float: left; padding: 0 20px 20px 0;">See that sticker? We want that to be your sticker. Don't you want that to be your sticker? We thought so. So we're giving it to you. All you have to do is contribute to the Dev Center&mdash;<a href="https://github.com/iron-io/docs/issues/new">open an issue</a> or fix something and send us a pull request. Not only do you get a better Dev Center, you get a really sweet sticker. How's that for a win-win?</p>

<p style="clear: both;">For our more active contributors, we have these really cool t-shirts, as well. You can hack away on your latest super-cool project <em>in style</em> with this awesome shirt&mdash;the very same shirts our team sports so fashionably! We award these for continued and significant contributions to the Dev Center, so just keep filing issues and sending pull requests, and we'll get in touch.</p>

<h3>But wait, there's more!</h3>

<p>We also send out free coffee, energy drinks, and other assorted goodies to contributors, at our discretion. These can be anything from hackerfuel to limited edition Iron.io swag, and we'll come up with new fun criteria for awarding each, so the best way to optimise your chances of getting some is to just be an active community member. Even if you don't get swag, being an active community member is pretty fun. Try it; you'll like it.</p>
