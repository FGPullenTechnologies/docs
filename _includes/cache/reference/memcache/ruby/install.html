The sample uses the memcache-client gem; you'll need to install it 
before you can use the sample.

<strong>Note:</strong> The popular Dalli client <strong>will not</strong> 
work, as it requires support for the binary memcached protocol, which 
IronCache does not support at this time.

To install memcache-client, just run the following from your command line:

{% highlight bash %}
gem install memcache-client
{% endhighlight %}
