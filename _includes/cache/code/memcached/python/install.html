The sample uses the python-memcached client; you'll need to install it 
before you can use the sample.

To install python-memcached, just run the following from your command line:

{% highlight bash %}
pip install python-memcached
{% endhighlight %}

If you prefer <span class="fixed-width">easy_install</span>, you can run:

{% highlight bash %}
easy_install python-memcached
{% endhighlight %}
