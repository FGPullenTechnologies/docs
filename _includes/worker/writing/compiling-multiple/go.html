<p>Because you changed your source files, you'll need to recompile your worker. Run the following from the root of your project (<span class="fixed-width">~/iron/myworker</span> in our example):

<figcaption><span>Command Line </span></figcaption>
{% highlight bash %}
GOOS=linux GOARCH=amd64 go build
{% endhighlight %}

<p>This will compile your worker to a file named <span class="fixed-width">hello</span> in the root of your project.</p>
