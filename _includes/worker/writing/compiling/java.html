<p>IronWorker runs your Java programs from JAR files, so you're going to need to compile that <span class="fixed-width">Hello.java</span> file and create a JAR out of it.</p>

<p>First, you'll need to create a <span class="fixed-width">manifest.txt</span> file in the root of your project (<span class="fixed-width">~/iron/myworker</span> in our example). It should look like this:

<figcaption><span>~/iron/myworker/manifest.txt </span></figcaption>
<div class="grey-box">
Main-Class: Hello
</div>

<p>Next, you'll need to run the following commands from the root of your project (<span class="fixed-width">~/iron/myworker</span> in our example):</p>

<figcaption><span>Command Line </span></figcaption>
{% highlight bash %}
$ javac Hello.java
$ jar cfm hello.jar manifest.txt
{% endhighlight %}

<p>This will create <span class="fixed-width">hello.jar</span> file in the root of your project.</p>
