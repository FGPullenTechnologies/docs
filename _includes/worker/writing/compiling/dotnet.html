<p>Before you can run your .NET files on IronWorker, it needs to be compiled to a .exe file that Mono can run. To do this, run the following command from the root of your project (<span class="fixed-width">~/iron/myworker</span> in our example):</p>

<figcaption><span>Command Line </span></figcaption>
{% highlight bash %}
$ gmcs hello.cs
{% endhighlight %}

<p>This will create a <span class="fixed-width">hello.exe</span> in the root of your project.</p>
