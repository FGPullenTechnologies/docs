<p>IronWorker tasks are flexible; they don't have to be queued immediately. Rather, you can schedule a task to be queued at a specific time or after a set amount of time. This article shows you how to create them using the <span class="fixed-width">iron_worker_ng</span> Ruby gem, but they can be scheduled from any <a href="/worker/languages">client library</a> or even from <a href="/worker/reference/api">the API</a>.</p>

<p>Scheduled jobs are separate resources than queued tasks. When scheduled tasks run, they queue a task to execute the worker code. The Scheduled Task has a Scheduled ID. The task that executes is separate and has a distinct Task ID. You monitor Scheduled Tasks in the Schedule tab in the HUD. Tasks that subsequently queued can be monitored within the Task tab.</p>

<div class="alert">
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Scheduled tasks may not be <em>executed</em> at the scheduled time; they will simply be placed on the queue at that time. Depending on the circumstances, a task may be executed a short time after it is scheduled to be. Tasks will never be executed before their schedule, however. (Scheduled tasks can be given a priority; higher priorities can reduce the time in queue.)</p>
</div>

<p>Scheduling a task to be queued at a specific time is easy:</p>

<div class="ruby">

```ruby
schedule = client.schedules.create('MyWorker', payload, {:start_at => Time.now + 3600})
```
</div>

<p>To run on a regular schedule, then just include an interval to repeat execution of the scheduled task. (This is useful, for example, for sending out daily notifications or cleaning up old database entries.)</p>

<div class="ruby">

```ruby
schedule = client.schedules.create('MyWorker', payload, {:run_every => 3600}) # will be run every hour
```
</div>

<p>These repeating tasks can also be set to queued at a specific start time:</p>

<div class="ruby">

```ruby
schedule = client.schedules.create('MyWorker', payload, {:start_at => Time.now + 3600, :run_every => 3600}) # will be run every hour, starting an hour from now
```
</div>

<p>You can also schedule a task to be queued after a certain delay:</p>

<div class="ruby">

```ruby
schedule = client.tasks.create('MyWorker', payload, {:delay => 3600}) # queues the task after one hour
```
</div>

<div class="alert">
<p><strong>Note:</strong>You can use a delay for a scheduled job <strong>and</strong> for a <a href="http://dev.iron.io/worker/reference/api/#queue_a_task">queued task</a>. The difference is a delayed scheduled task will kick off a regular task whereas a delayed task executes directly (after the delay). We suggest using a delayed task if the delay time is brief; a scheduled task if it's longer into the future and/or repeats frequently. See the note below, however, on good practices especially for large numbers of individual  tasks to run in the future.</p>
</div>

<p>Finally, you can also control how many times a repeating task is run:</p>

<div class="ruby">

```ruby
schedule = client.schedules.create('MyWorker', payload, {:start_at => Time.now + 3600, :run_every => 3600, :run_times => 24 }) # will be run every hour for one day, starting an hour from now
```
</div>


<h2>Best Practices</h2>
<ul>
	<li>
	<p>Many Tasks To Run in Future - If you have lots of the same individual tasks to run in the future (sending emails to users, for example), we suggest <strong>not</strong> creating individual scheduled tasks (or queuing lots of tasks with delays). It's better to create a scheduled task that repeats on a regular basis. This scheduled task should then query a data base or datastore for the users to email (or actions to take). It can then spin up one or more sub-tasks to execute the work (creating one task per action or better yet, allocating a certain number of data slices to each task to better amortize the setup cost of a task).</p>

	<p>Here are a few posts on the topic:</p>

		<li><a href="http://blog.iron.io/2011/07/anti-pattern-lots-of-scheduled-jobs.html">Anti-Pattern: Lots of Scheduled Jobs</a></li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Finer-Grained Scheduling - There may be the need to run tasks on specific days or dates (end of month or Tuesday and Thursday). We recommend creating a scheduled job that runs frequently and then does a quick check to see if the scheduling condition is met. For example, running daily and checking if it's the last day of the month or a Tuesday or Thursday. If so, then continue with the task; if not, then exit. (We're looking at addressing finer-grain scheduling options but don't accommodate it at present.)</li>
	<li>Specific times are expressed as time objects and so can be in UTC or local time. They'll be recorded in the system as UTC but displayed in the HUD/dashboard in the timezone that you specify for the HUD.</li>
</ul>
