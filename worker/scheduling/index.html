IronWorker tasks are flexible; they don't have to be queued immediately. Rather, you can schedule a task to be queued at a specific time or after a set amount of time. This article shows you how to create them using the `iron_worker_ng` Ruby gem, but they can be scheduled from any <a href="/worker/languages">client library</a> or even from <a href="/worker/reference/api">the API</a>.

<div class="alert">
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Tasks may not be <em>executed</em> at the scheduled time; they will simply be placed on the queue at that time. Depending on the circumstances, a task may be executed a short time after it is scheduled to be. Tasks will never be executed before their schedule, however.</p>
</div>

Scheduling a task to be queued at a specific time is easy:

<div class="ruby">
{% highlight ruby %}
schedule = client.schedules.create('MyWorker', payload, {:start_at => Time.now + 3600})
{% endhighlight %}
</div>

You can also schedule a task to be queued after a certain delay:

<div class="ruby">
{% highlight ruby %}
schedule = client.tasks.create('MyWorker', payload, {:delay => 3600}) # queues the task after one hour
{% endhighlight %}
</div>

Some tasks, like sending out daily notifications or cleaning up old database entries, are more useful when run on a repeating schedule. IronWorker supports creating tasks that will run at set intervals:

<div class="ruby">
{% highlight ruby %}
schedule = client.schedules.create('MyWorker', payload, {:run_every => 3600}) # will be run every hour
{% endhighlight %}
</div>

These repeating tasks can also be set to queued at a specific time:

<div class="ruby">
{% highlight ruby %}
schedule = client.schedules.create('MyWorker', payload, {:start_at => Time.now + 3600, :run_every => 3600}) # will be run every hour, starting an hour from now
{% endhighlight %}
</div>

Finally, you can also control how many times a repeating task is run:

<div class="ruby">
{% highlight ruby %}
schedule = client.schedules.create('MyWorker', payload, {:start_at => Time.now + 3600, :run_every => 3600, :run_times => 24 }) # will be run every hour for one day, starting an hour from now
{% endhighlight %}
</div>
