IronWorker is available as a Third Party Service within the Pivotal Web Services Marketplace, allowing developers to leverage the service directly with their cloud native applications. IronWorker by Iron.io is an event-driven computing platform that leverages containers for its runtime, giving developers and systems architects an effective environment for powering asynchronous workloads at massive scale. IronWorker gives you a flexible way to run tens, hundreds, or thousands of tasks at once without having to stand up servers or manage queues. Offload tasks from your app, schedule jobs to run later, or fire off tasks from webhooks. IronWorker scales out the processing to let you focus on building out the features of your applications.
