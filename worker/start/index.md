# Getting Started with IronWorker

The first thing you should do is write your first worker and queue up a task for the worker so you
can get a feel for how things work.  The basic process for creating and running a worker is:

1. Write your worker code
1. Upload your worker
1. Queue up tasks for your worker or schedule it

Those are the main concepts you'll need to know.

Now let's get you setup and making workers!

1. [Sign Up](http://www.iron.io) for a free Iron.io account
2. [Get an OAuth2 Token](http://hud.iron.io/tokens)
3. [Setup your credentials](/articles/configuration)
3. Click the language of your choice on the menu on the left to learn how to write your first worker.
