The first thing you should do is write your first worker and queue up a task for the worker so you
can get a feel for how things work.

2. [Get an OAuth2 Token](http://hud.iron.io/tokens)
3. [Setup your credentials](/articles/configuration)
3. Click the language of your choice on the menu on the left to learn how to write your first worker.
