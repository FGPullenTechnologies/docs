If you are using the deprecated IronWorker NG client (Ruby cli with .worker files), the documentation
for that is still available here: <a href="http://dev-deprecated.iron.io/worker/">http://dev-deprecated.iron.io/worker/</a>.
We recommend
migrating to the new Docker workflow as it's much easier and more productive to use
since you can test locally. The migration process is very simple, just run the commands
you see here <a href="https://github.com/iron-io/dockerworker/">https://github.com/iron-io/dockerworker/</a> for your language .
