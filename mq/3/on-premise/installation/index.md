This section will guide you through the installation of a complete High Availability IronMQ
configuration. Installation will require some knowledge of deployment and systems
administration. If you don't have these skills, please schedule a consultation with our
team.

This guide is split into two parts:

1. [Setting up a full-featured single node](/mq/3/on-premise/installation/single.html) - good for small staging environments
2. [Completing the HA setup by adding more nodes](/mq/3/on-premise/installation/ha.html) - good for larger staging and full
production environments. This part builds on #1

Note: If you've never used IronMQ and are evaluating it, please try IronMQ Lite
to run and test it locally.

[Get started with single node setup](/mq/3/on-premise/installation/single.html).
